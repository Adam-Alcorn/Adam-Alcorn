      <button class="accordion">About Me</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>For four years of my life I took part in the local Scouting group in Limavady.
          This taught me a lot about the community and working with others. During
          this time, I achieved the Chief Scout Award, being the first ever in our
          group to receive this. My time with the Scouts taught me the importance
          of helping others, to work within a team and progress towards a goal under
          pressure.</p>
        <p>One of my hobbies is programming. Over the past three years I have done
          website creation, Flash game design, SQL database modelling, and Java development.
          A lot of the elements within my course at university have helped fuel the
          passion that I hold for computers.</p>
        <p>I have always had a love for music and I collect and play various stringed
          instruments. These range from banjos to ukuleles and mandolins. During
          my first year at Queens University I met up with other students who also
          enjoy playing and composing music.</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>My first experience of working was when I volunteered to help in a local
          garden centre as part of my Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme. This involved
          using creativity, working within a small team and dealing with the general
          public.
          <br>
          <br>During the summer of 2016 I worked at a church in Londonderry where I
          was a tour guide for people wishing to know more about the history of St
          Augustine’s Church. I learnt a lot about the history of the city and enjoyed
          meeting people from all over the world.
          <br>
          <br>For two and a half years I was employed in a local supermarket where I
          was a valued member of staff. During this time, I observed how computers
          were used on a daily basis in the management of a business, the ordering
          of stock, fuel management, and data input and output systems.</p>

        <br>• Musical Instruments – I collect and play stringed instruments, these
        range from mandolins, to banjos, ukuleles and guitars.
        <br>• Gaming – Gaming is a big part of my life as I founded a gaming Discord
        community for people who wish to socialize whilst they play. This also
        gave me an opportunity to code and run bots for automation purposes within
        the Discord application.
        <br>• Outdoor Activity – Being in the Scouts gave me an appreciation for the
        outdoors. I enjoy hiking, canoeing, kayaking and many more different sports.
        <br>• Programming – Programming is a hobby for me, and I try to learn about
        new and upcoming technologies, I am especially interested in programming
        Amazons Echo Dot.
